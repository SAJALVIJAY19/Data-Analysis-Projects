# 💳 Digital Banking Intelligence: Churn & Engagement Analysis

### 📊 Advanced Financial Analytics Project | Power BI + Python + Machine Learning

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer behavior and digital banking adoption patterns in a financial institution using a real-world bank customer dataset. Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and machine learning, we uncover insights into customer churn and digital engagement levels, helping drive data-informed decisions.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Understand **which customer groups adopt digital banking more**
- Identify **key traits that correlate with churn**
- Build **predictive models** to forecast churn and engagement risk
- Pinpoint **high-potential customers** for cross-selling digital services
- Deliver all findings through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- 🔍 **High churn** is linked to:
  - Low digital engagement score
  - High credit utilization
  - Short customer tenure
  - Younger and divorced customers

- ✅ **Digital adoption** is higher among:
  - Age group 30–50
  - Higher card tiers (Gold, Platinum)
  - Customers with higher credit limits and graduate-level education

- 🔄 **Churn Prediction** using machine learning classifiers (Naive Bayes, XGBoost) achieved >85% accuracy and identified at-risk segments with high confidence.

- 💡 **Cross-sell potential** exists in moderate-engagement customers with stable financial profiles.
